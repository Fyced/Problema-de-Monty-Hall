This project was made to help my high school classmates understand the problem, and moreover understand the basics of staticstics.

It recreates the classic Monty-Hall problem, with the difference that you can decide the number of total doors

And then it is just the same problem, you choose one door, the others are shown, except for one.

And you have to decide whether to keep your door or to change to the other one.
